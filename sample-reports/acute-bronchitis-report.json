  "title": "Acute Bronchitis - Upper Respiratory Infection",
  "content": "Patient presented to clinic with complaints of persistent cough and chest congestion for the past 5 days.\n\nChief Complaint:\n\"I've had this terrible cough for almost a week and can't seem to shake it. I'm coughing up yellow-green mucus and feel exhausted.\"\n\nHistory of Present Illness:\nPatient reports onset of symptoms 5 days ago, starting with sore throat and runny nose. Developed productive cough on day 2 with initially clear, then yellow-green sputum. Reports chest tightness and wheezing, especially at night. No fever currently, but had low-grade fever (100.2°F) for first 2 days. Denies shortness of breath at rest. Symptoms worse in the morning and when lying down.\n\nAssociated Symptoms:\n- Fatigue and malaise\n- Nasal congestion (improving)\n- Post-nasal drip\n- Mild headache (resolved)\n- Decreased appetite\n- Difficulty sleeping due to cough\n\nDenies:\n- High fever (>101°F)\n- Significant shortness of breath\n- Chest pain\n- Hemoptysis (coughing up blood)\n- Recent travel\n- Known sick contacts with COVID-19\n\nCurrent Medications:\n- None regular\n- Has been taking over-the-counter ibuprofen 400mg for discomfort\n- Using throat lozenges\n\nPast Medical History:\n- Generally healthy\n- No chronic respiratory conditions\n- No history of asthma or COPD\n- Last similar illness: 2 years ago\n\nSocial History:\n- Non-smoker\n- No exposure to secondhand smoke\n- Works in office environment\n- No recent environmental exposures\n\nVital Signs:\n- Temperature: 98.8°F (afebrile)\n- Blood Pressure: 122/78 mmHg\n- Heart Rate: 82 bpm, regular\n- Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths/min\n- Oxygen Saturation: 96% on room air\n- Weight: 75 kg\n\nPhysical Examination:\n- General: Alert, tired-appearing but not in distress. Frequent coughing during exam\n- HEENT: Nasal mucosa slightly erythematous with clear discharge. Pharynx mildly erythematous, no exudates. Tympanic membranes clear\n- Neck: No lymphadenopathy, trachea midline\n- Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs\n- Respiratory: \n  * Inspection: No increased work of breathing, no accessory muscle use\n  * Auscultation: Scattered rhonchi and wheezes bilaterally, more prominent in lower lung fields\n  * No rales or crackles appreciated\n  * Resonant to percussion\n  * Productive cough with yellow-green sputum observed\n- Abdomen: Soft, mild tenderness in upper abdomen (likely from coughing), no guarding\n- Extremities: No cyanosis or edema\n\nDiagnostic Considerations:\n- Clinical presentation consistent with acute bronchitis\n- No clinical features suggesting pneumonia (no high fever, no focal consolidation on exam)\n- COVID-19 rapid antigen test: Negative\n- Influenza rapid test: Negative\n- Pulse oximetry normal - no hypoxemia\n\nCXR not indicated at this time given:\n- Normal vital signs\n- Normal oxygen saturation\n- No focal findings on lung exam\n- Age <65 years\n- No significant comorbidities",
  "diagnosis": "Acute Bronchitis (Viral Upper Respiratory Infection)\n\nPrimary Diagnosis:\nAcute bronchitis, likely viral etiology based on clinical presentation, symptom progression, and negative rapid viral tests. Characterized by inflammation of the bronchial airways leading to productive cough with purulent sputum.\n\nClinical Reasoning:\n- Symptoms consistent with viral upper respiratory infection progressing to lower airways\n- Yellow-green sputum does NOT necessarily indicate bacterial infection (can be viral)\n- No signs of pneumonia (normal vital signs, no focal consolidation)\n- Self-limited condition expected to resolve in 2-3 weeks\n- Negative COVID-19 and influenza tests\n\nDifferential Diagnoses Considered:\n- Pneumonia: Ruled out (no fever, normal O2 sat, no focal findings)\n- COVID-19: Ruled out (negative test)\n- Influenza: Ruled out (negative test)\n- Pertussis (whooping cough): Less likely (vaccination history current, no paroxysmal cough)\n- Asthma exacerbation: No prior history of asthma\n\nNo antibiotics indicated at this time as acute bronchitis is typically viral and antibiotics do not improve outcomes.",
  "prescription": "Symptomatic Treatment (No Antibiotics Required):\n\n1. Dextromethorphan-Guaifenesin (Cough Suppressant + Expectorant)\n   - Dosage: 10-20 mL every 4 hours as needed\n   - Maximum: 6 doses per 24 hours\n   - Take with plenty of water\n   - Use for nighttime cough relief\n\n2. Albuterol Inhaler (Bronchodilator) - Short-term use\n   - Dosage: 2 puffs every 4-6 hours as needed for wheezing\n   - Maximum: 12 puffs per day\n   - Use with spacer if available\n   - Prescribed for 2 weeks\n   - Discontinue when wheezing resolves\n\n3. Ibuprofen 400mg\n   - Take every 6-8 hours as needed for discomfort\n   - Take with food\n   - Maximum: 3 doses per day\n\n4. Over-the-Counter Recommendations:\n   - Guaifenesin 400mg every 4 hours (expectorant - helps thin mucus)\n   - Honey (1-2 teaspoons as needed for cough relief)\n   - Throat lozenges as needed\n   - Nasal saline spray for congestion\n\nNo Antibiotics Prescribed Because:\n- Acute bronchitis is typically viral\n- Antibiotics do not improve outcomes in uncomplicated acute bronchitis\n- Patient does not meet criteria for bacterial infection\n- Risks of antibiotics outweigh benefits in this case",
  "recommendations": "Home Care and Symptom Management:\n\n1. Hydration:\n   - Drink 8-10 glasses of water daily\n   - Warm liquids (tea, broth, warm lemon water with honey)\n   - Avoid caffeine and alcohol (dehydrating)\n\n2. Rest:\n   - Get adequate sleep (7-9 hours)\n   - Take time off work if possible (2-3 days)\n   - Avoid strenuous activities until feeling better\n\n3. Cough Management:\n   - Use humidifier or vaporizer in bedroom\n   - Breathe steam from hot shower\n   - Elevate head while sleeping (use extra pillows)\n   - Avoid irritants (smoke, strong odors, cold air)\n   - Practice controlled coughing to clear mucus\n\n4. Respiratory Care:\n   - Practice deep breathing exercises\n   - Use pursed-lip breathing if wheezing\n   - Sit upright when experiencing cough\n   - Perform gentle chest percussion (tap on chest/back)\n\n5. Nutrition:\n   - Eat light, nutritious meals\n   - Chicken soup (anti-inflammatory properties)\n   - Foods rich in Vitamin C\n   - Avoid dairy if it seems to thicken mucus\n\n6. Infection Control:\n   - Frequent hand washing\n   - Cover mouth when coughing (use elbow, not hands)\n   - Avoid close contact with others\n   - Clean frequently touched surfaces\n   - Consider wearing mask in public spaces\n\nExpected Recovery Timeline:\n- Improvement expected within 5-7 days\n- Cough may persist for 2-3 weeks (normal)\n- Fatigue may last 1-2 weeks\n- Most symptoms should resolve by 3 weeks\n\nFollow-up:\n1. Call clinic in 3-5 days to update on progress\n2. Return visit only if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop\n3. No routine follow-up needed if improving as expected\n\nRed Flags - Seek Immediate Medical Attention If:\n- High fever >101.5°F (38.6°C) or fever lasting >3 days\n- Severe shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n- Chest pain, especially with breathing\n- Coughing up blood\n- Confusion or altered mental status\n- Severe fatigue or weakness\n- Symptoms significantly worsening instead of improving\n- Inability to keep down fluids\n- Persistent vomiting\n- Signs of dehydration (dark urine, dizziness, dry mouth)\n\nWhen to Consider Antibiotics:\nReturn to clinic for re-evaluation if:\n- No improvement after 7-10 days\n- Symptoms worsen significantly\n- Development of high fever\n- Signs suggesting secondary bacterial infection\n\nPrevention for Future:\n1. Annual influenza vaccination\n2. Pneumococcal vaccine if eligible\n3. Practice good hand hygiene\n4. Avoid sick contacts when possible\n5. Maintain healthy lifestyle (diet, exercise, sleep)\n6. Consider COVID-19 booster if due\n\nWork/School:\n- May return to work when fever-free for 24 hours\n- May return when cough is no longer severely disruptive\n- Practice good respiratory hygiene if returning while still symptomatic\n- Consider remote work for a few days if possible\n\nPrognosis:\nExcellent. Acute bronchitis is a self-limited condition. Full recovery expected within 2-3 weeks with symptomatic treatment and supportive care."
